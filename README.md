# Solving Traffic problems via Emergence - Study Project

>We are trying to use the knowledge of Complex Adaptive Systems to try and solve the problems of traffic via the phenomena of emergence.

###PROBLEMS TO TACKLE:
* phantom jams (unexpected jams which propogate like shock waves)
* untangling traffic congestions 
* decentralized decisive behaviors which enable choosing least crowded lanes leading to same destination
*
